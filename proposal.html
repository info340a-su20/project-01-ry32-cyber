    <h4>Project Overview</h4>
    <p>
    Covid 19 has been a global pandemic issue since the end of 2019. People worldwide are largely impacted by the spread of Covid 19. They need to get well informed in order to respond to the pandemic. It's important to collect and present the information in an understandable way so that government officals, researchers, healthcare professionals, and the general public can be prepared to the current pandemic.
    </p>

    <h4>Information Technology problem</h4>
    <p>
    How can we collect and present data to show distribution of COIVD 19 cases across different states in US. 
    </p>

    <h4>Existing solution</h4>
    <p>
    There are multiple websites and facillities are collecting COVID 19 data. States government, public health department in different states will provide updates on confirmed new cases on a regular basis. CSSE at Johns Hopkins University also generated visual interactive distribution map for COVID 19 cases in US and worldwide.

    <h2>App Description</h2>
     <h4>Users</h4>
     <p>Users can be anyone who want to get insights on the spread of COVID 19 in US, and understand the severity of COVID 19 in their area and nation wide overtime.   
     </p>

     <h4>External Source</h4>
     <p>I will be using a .csv file dataset from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data">our World in Data</a>. This dataset includes data on number of confirmed  cases, covid 19 tests, total deaths, etc. There is also a dataset available in the github repo provided by nytimes, here is the <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data">link</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Interactions</h4>
    <p>The interactions I wish to build are:
        <ul>
            <li>Users can view the distribution of Covid 19 cases and data by states on a visual map. </li>
            <li>Users can view the general trend of Covid 19 cases overtime by states through a linear chart. </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>solution</h4>
    <p>This app will help solve the problem since it provide information through visual graphs and maps, making the data more accessible and readable to the users.
